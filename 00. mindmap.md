### dataset
0. colect data
1. cleaning/organizing data
3. exploring data
4. [pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/)

### model
A model is a set of rules the computer follows to complete a task.  

### compilation

### fitting (training)

### evaluation

...

### math
wx + b = y  

S(yยน) = e^y^i / Ej * e ^yj  


#### Multinomial Logistic Classification
D(S(wx+b),L)  

Where  
D = distance,  
S = softmax function  
w = weight,  
x =  
b = bias,  
L = label
